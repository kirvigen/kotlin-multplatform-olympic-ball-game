## üìñ About The Game

Olympic Ball Games is a unique fusion of classic ball-merging mechanics and Olympic themes. Players combine balls representing different Olympic host cities to create larger, more valuable balls. As you progress, you'll unlock new cities and climb the global leaderboard!

## üåü Features

- **Olympic Themed**: Each ball represents a city that has hosted the Olympic Games.
- **Merge Mechanics**: Combine same-sized balls to create larger ones.
- **Dynamic Gameplay**: Gravity and physics make each game session unique.
- **Progressive Difficulty**: The game becomes more challenging as you advance.
- **Global Leaderboard**: Compete with players worldwide for the top spot.
- **Beautiful Graphics**: Enjoy smooth animations and vibrant visuals.

## üèôÔ∏è Dataset

The game uses a customizable dataset. Here's a snippet of the current dataset:

```kotlin
val olympicSummerCities = listOf(
    BallType(
        image = Res.drawable.paris,
        name = "Paris",
        mass = 512,
        additionalInformation = "in 2024"
    ),
    BallType(
        image = Res.drawable.tokyo,
        name = "Tokyo",
        mass = 256,
        additionalInformation = "in 2020 (held in 2021)"
    ),
    BallType(
        image = Res.drawable.rio,
        name = "Rio de Janeiro",
        mass = 128,
        additionalInformation = "in 2016"
    ),
    BallType(
        image = Res.drawable.london,
        name = "London",
        mass = 64,
        additionalInformation = "in 2012"
    )
    // More cities can be added here
)
```

You can easily modify this dataset to add new cities, change masses, or update information. The `mass` value represents the ball's size and importance, with larger values for more recent games.
